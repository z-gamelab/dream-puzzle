			To start a new game, click the "New Game" button on the main menu. 
			You will be presented a complete 220 piece puzzle organized into four sliders. 
			There will be six randomly chosen puzzle pieces at the bottom of the screen below the sliders. 
			The object of the game is to find the match for each of these six pieces which is scattered somewhere throughout the four sliders above. 
			Begin by choosing a piece (or multiple pieces) and browse the sliders until you find one. 
			When you believe you have matched it, tap on it. It will flash red and copy into the next slider down. 
			If you chose "New Game" it will pre-pend the piece at the beginning of the next slider so that you can easily tap again. 
			If you choose "Challenge Mode" the piece will copy randomly into the next slider for you to find before tapping again. 
			Proceed to tap the piece down the sliders until you reach the lowest slider. 
			If you tap again from the final slider and you have correctly matched one of the pieces, that piece will light up. 
			Once you have found and lit up all six pieces, you will be given the opportunity to make a guess at the completed puzzle. 
			If you are correct, you will be credited 10 store credits. You may also opt to skip this by choosing "No." 
			Either way the completed puzzle will be revealed. 
			When you close the picture you will be presented the option to save the picture as your phone background and to begin a new game. 
			New games will continue in the mode you chose on the main menu.<br><br>
			Store credits will accumulate as you make successful puzzle guesses.
			There will be puzzle packs released on a regular basis for purchase in the store.
			In the store you will see your accumulated store credit. 
			There will also be packs of credit that you can purchase.
			Choose "Visit Store" from the main menu to see the options.
			You will also be presented the option to visit the store when you have exhausted the puzzles currently unlocked.
