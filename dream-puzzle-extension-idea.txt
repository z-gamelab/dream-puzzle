idea for extending the game:

when users match all six puzzle pieces, offer an opportunity to submit a guess at what the picture might be. Devise some meta data for each main-image such that it can be matched. If a match is found for the guess, unlock x amount of "coin" for the user. These "coin" can be accumulated to buy further puzzle packs as a free to play option. This way "coin" can also be offered for sale along with puzzle packs directly.

Also, find out if app can offer users the option to save the image to their background once revealed since these are meant to be phone background images.
